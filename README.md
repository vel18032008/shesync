Turning period fear into knowledge and confidence.

## Features

## Why SheSync?

Many teen girls grow up without clear menstrual education. SheSync creates a safe digital space to learn, track, and ask questions without embarrassment.

This project focuses on empowerment, health literacy, and breaking stigma through technology.
